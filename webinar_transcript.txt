# Effectful Programming Core Bounty - $1,500

Build anything (any domain, any UI, any stack). The only thing we care about: effectful programming is the core architectural paradigm of your submission.

Prizes

* 🥇 $1,000 - 1st place
* 🥈 $500 - 2nd place

## What "effectful programming core" means

Your app’s primary control flow should be expressed in an effect system (or effect-typed abstraction) where side effects are explicit, composable, and controlled.

Effects include (non-exhaustive): I/O, persistence, network calls, time, randomness, concurrency, cancellation, resource acquisition/release, logging/telemetry, errors/retries.

We’re looking for projects where:

* effects are modeled explicitly (not scattered ad-hoc),
* effectful workflows are composed into pipelines/services,
* execution happens via a runtime/interpreter at the edges,
* the design makes reasoning, testing, and failure handling *better*, not worse.
